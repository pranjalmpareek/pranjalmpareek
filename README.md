- 👋 Hi, I’m @pranjalmpareek
- 🌱 I’m currently working at Flipkart, India's largest e-commerce company where I lead automation design for the supply chain.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code so that I can build something of my own and understand what my team is building.
- 👍 I'm currently learning Javascript and Python after a hiatus of more than a decade. Exciting stuff!
- 📫 How to reach me: pranjalmpareek[at]gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't understand
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was doing management after my engineering, and am doing engineering after I did my MBA.
